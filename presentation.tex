% IMPORTANT
% THIS DOCUMENT REQUIRES LuaLaTeX OR XeLaTeX AS THE PROCESSING ENGINE
% SOME "SPECIAL" VARIABLES HAVE BEEN SET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE TO HELP
% IT SHOULD WORK AUTOMATICALLY WITH TeXstudio AND Emacs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Beamer is the presentation class
\documentclass[12pt]{beamer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Read the Beamer documentation.
% It is very powerful, but it can be a bit tricky to get right.
% Slides can receive positioning options such as \begin{frame}[t],
% content options such as [plain] or for verbatim environments [fragile].
% If a slide should be "breakable", the use the [allowframebreaks] option
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For general information and help about LaTeX, refer to https://www.overleaf.com/learn

%%% Packages
% Please, read the "loaded-thesis.sty" document to see what is actually loaded and how to use it. Some configuration options for a set of packages is also present there. Change those if you need it.
\usepackage{loaded-thesis}

%% References configuration
\usepackage[nameinlink]{cleveref} % Better referencing that default LaTeX or \hyperref. Must be loaded after hyperref and asmmath

%% Language configuration

\usepackage[spanish, english]{babel}
% The last language in the list is the main language of the document.
% Select your preferred language, change the language in the middel of the document by using \selectlanguage{spanish}
% babel also allows to change the font used depending on the language
% IMPORTANT: if you compile the document with one language (say english) and then change it to another, the automatically generated files in the directory need to be deleted! Especially the .aux file!


%% Bibliography configuration

\usepackage[backend=biber,
			style=numeric,
			sorting=none]{biblatex}
			% Citation configuration. We use biblatex, which is more
			% complex, but as customizable as it gets.
			% Please, modify this to your liking.
			% IMPORTANT: this requires biber to be installed and run every time
			% you change the .bib file! To make it easier, if you are using TeXStudio, do the following:
			% 1. Go to options. 2. Select the Build menu. 3 In standard bibliography, change bibtex to biber. 4. Profit
			% These changes will allow the editor to detect any changes and "recompile" the files if needed.
			% For other editors see: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations
			% See link for a quick introduction: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/26516/how-to-use-biber/34136
			% If you are having issues with the bibliography, please, search for how to install and run biber!

			% Specialised packages. Please, read their documentation as they provide a lot of functionality.

%%% Font configuration

	colorlinks = true, % Colour links. Set to false to let the text be black
	citecolor = red,
