% IMPORTANT
% THIS DOCUMENT REQUIRES LuaLaTeX OR XeLaTeX AS THE PROCESSING ENGINE
% SOME "SPECIAL" VARIABLES HAVE BEEN SET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE TO HELP
% IT SHOULD WORK AUTOMATICALLY WITH TeXstudio AND Emacs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%
% Important. The packages and some extra functionality is found in the loaded-thesis.sty file!
% Read it to learn more about what you can do with LaTeX and how things are configured.
%%%

% General document definition. In order to have the text completely centered, do not use the twoside option; however, twoside is recommended for printing.
\documentclass[12pt, a4paper, twoside]{book}

% For general information and help about LaTeX, refer to https://www.overleaf.com/learn

%%% Packages
% Please, read the "loaded-thesis.sty" document to see what is actually loaded and how to use it. Some configuration options for a set of packages is also present there. Change those if you need it.
\usepackage{loaded-thesis}

%% References configuration
\usepackage[nameinlink]{cleveref} % Better referencing that default LaTeX or \hyperref. Must be loaded after hyperref and asmmath

%% Language configuration

\usepackage[spanish, english]{babel}
% The last language in the list is the main language of the document.
% Select your preferred language, change the language in the middel of the document by using \selectlanguage{spanish}
% babel also allows to change the font used depending on the language
% IMPORTANT: if you compile the document with one language (say english) and then change it to another, the automatically generated files in the directory need to be deleted! Especially the .aux file!

%% Bibliography configuration

\usepackage[backend=biber,
			style=numeric,
			sorting=none]{biblatex}
			% Citation configuration. We use biblatex, which is more
			% complex, but as customizable as it gets.
			% Please, modify this to your liking.
			% IMPORTANT: this requires biber to be installed and run every time
			% you change the .bib file! To make it easier, if you are using TeXStudio, do the following:
			% 1. Go to options. 2. Select the Build menu. 3 In standard bibliography, change bibtex to biber. 4. Profit
			% These changes will allow the editor to detect any changes and "recompile" the files if needed.
			% For other editors see: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations
			% See link for a quick introduction: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/26516/how-to-use-biber/34136
			% If you are having issues with the bibliography, please, search for how to install and run biber!

			% Specialised packages. Please, read their documentation as they provide a lot of functionality.

% Bibliography resource
\addbibresource{main.bib} % Read bibliography entries/database

\renewcommand*{\nameyeardelim}{\addcomma\addspace} % To add a coma after et al. -> et al.,

%%% Acronyms and glossary

%% Force processing of glossaries
\makeglossaries

% Read the documentation of glossaries and glossaries-extra. They are incredibly powerful,
% but may require some fiddling to get things exactly how you may want them!

%% Acronyms
% Set the short-long style. It prints the long version the first time an acronym is used
\setabbreviationstyle[acronym]{long-short}
% The acronyms definitions are found in the acronym.tex file.
% Modify that file accordingly
\loadglsentries[\acronymtype]{acronyms.tex}

%% Glossary terms
\loadglsentries{glossaries.tex}

%%% Font configuration

% Change the mono font in order to support more Unicode characters
\setmonofont{DejaVu Sans Mono}[Scale=MatchLowercase]

% Link colour setup. If you want colours, set "colorlinks" to "true"
\hypersetup{
	colorlinks = true, % Colour links. Set to false to let the text be black
	citecolor = red,
	urlcolor = blue,
	linkcolor = red,
%	hidelinks = true, % Uncomment to hide all link indications, such as boxes
} % Change this options to your liking

%%% PGFplots settings
% Version standard
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18} % Newest version as of 2022-09-23 is 1.18
% User the groupplot library to have the groupplot environment
\usepgfplotslibrary{groupplots}

% Increase the threshold for which a float is left alone (without text) in a page
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{.70}%

%%% Custom commands

% Add abstract environment to book style
\newenvironment{abstract}%
{\cleardoublepage \null \vfill \begin{center}%
		\bfseries \abstractname \end{center}}%
{\vfill\null}

% Hide environments
% Hide plots to speed up processing by uncommenting the following line
\newif\ifhidepgfplots
%\hidepgfplotstrue % Uncomment to hide plots
\ifhidepgfplots
 \usepackage{environ}
 \NewEnviron{hide}{}
 \let\tikzpicture\hide
 \let\endtikzpicture\endhide
\fi

\newfloat{genericfloat}{tbhp}{lop} % Added due to bad interaction between dpfloat and algorithm2e
